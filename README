This is a D1.0 binding to the Allegro 5 library: http://liballeg.org/

Should work fine with Allegro 5.0.0 (RC5). Pretty much all of the cross-platform functions are bound.
Non cross-platform functions are absent, but they will be added eventually.

Tested with LDC/Tango and DMD/Phobos compilers on Linux 64 bit

Installation:

If you have LDC:

./build_lib_ldc.sh
./build_example_ldc.sh

If you have DMD:

./build_lib_dmd.sh
./build_example_dmd.sh

Try the example by running:
./example

It should run and not crash

Feel free to copy the resulting libdallegro5.a and the imports into your preferred location for D imports.
Obviously, you also can skip the library building step and simply include these imports in your project.
