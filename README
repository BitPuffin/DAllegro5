This is a D1.0 and D2 binding to the Allegro 5 library: http://liballeg.org/

Should work fine with Allegro 5.0.0. Pretty much all of the cross-platform functions are bound.
Non cross-platform functions are absent, but they will be added eventually.

Tested with LDC/Tango and DMD/Phobos compilers on Linux 64 bit and DMD/Tango on Windows 32 bit (XP).

== Installation ==

== Linux ==

If you have LDC:

./build_lib_ldc.sh
./build_example_ldc.sh

If you have DMD:

./build_lib_dmd.sh
./build_example_dmd.sh

Try the example by running:
./example

It should run and not crash

== Windows ==

build_lib_dmd.bat

Feel free to copy the resulting libdallegro5.a and the imports into your preferred location for D imports.
Obviously, you also can skip the library building step and simply include these imports in your project.

== Notes ==

On Windows, you will need to generate the import libraries for Allegro's dll files using implib.exe that you can download here: http://ftp.digitalmars.com/bup.zip

Use it like this:

implib /s allegro_monolith-5.0.0-md.lib allegro_monolith-5.0.0-md.dll

To remove the console window that spawns whenever you run an Allegro program create a file with a .def extension with these contents:

EXETYPE NT
SUBSYSTEM WINDOWS

Then pass it to dmd when compiling like this:

dmd <your usual stuff goes here> file.def

On some systems Allegro windows will spawn without window borders. I don't know why this happens yet.
